title: My Biggest Challenges
---

My biggest challenge while learning to develop has not been with the content. I am fortunate in that programming makes sense to me, it fits with the way my brain works, and so I have been able to pick up concepts and quickly weaponize them.

Instead, my biggest challenges have come from within. As an older student making a mid-career pivot, and one who had no formal experience with development prior to this program, it has been occasionally challenging for me to get into the mindset of “being a developer”. I am learning the content, and gaining skills, but my lack of practical experience means that I don’t always know how things are going to translate to the real world. What skills should I focus on the most? What questions should I be asking my mentor/professors?

In short, I wonder if I am getting the most out of the program. An undergraduate degree in computer science, or an internship where I learn about development- those are things that would have helped me contextualize this experience. But I am taking a leap of faith. And while those challenges can be distracting and worrisome, they are not nearly enough to deter me or make me question my decision. Becoming a full-stack programmer is my passion, and even if this first stepping stone can feel a bit shaky at times, I look forward to the day where I look back on these “problems” and smile knowing that I overcame them.
