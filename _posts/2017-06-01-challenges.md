title: My Biggest Challenges
---

My biggest challenge this far has been discipline and motivation. The program can very challenging at times and it is easy to become discouraged and give up for the day. Even though you have a mentor, a lot of the time you are on your own and being self motivated can be difficult. I hope to stay positive and keep working towards my goal. I understand their will be many bumps in the road but there is always a solution, no matter how long it takes to find.
