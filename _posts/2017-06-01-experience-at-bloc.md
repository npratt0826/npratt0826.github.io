title: My Experience at Bloc
---

My experience at Bloc has been a rollercoaster thus far and I have learned a lot about programming and myself. My experience before Bloc was very limited but I feel it has done a good job at starting with the basics of html, css, and javascript and leading me to build my first app called blocJams. My biggest learning curve has been figuring out how to implement new code on my own through online research. There is an abundance of different examples everywhere but some use different languages and coding structures which can be confusing for a beginner. I have hit many walls, where I would work on the same task or bug for hours, sometimes days without any improvement. I now realize that this is all part of being a developer, but it can be extremely frustrating at times.

Having a mentor along the way has been very helpful and always gives me a different perspective on solving a problem. I could not imagine doing this program without him and it was a big reason I chose Bloc from the start.
