title: My Experience at Bloc
---

My experience at Bloc has been a rollercoaster thus far and I have learned a lot about programming and myself. My experience before Bloc was very limited but I feel it has done a good job at starting with the basics of html, css, and javascript and leading me to build my first app called blocJams. My biggest learning curve has been figuring out how to research code snippets from multiple sources and piece together want I need. There are so many languages and data structures, its tough to identify what's relevant to my project. I now realize how frustrating it can be and will continue to learn more each day. Its been a tough journey so far but I am excited for the challenges a head.
