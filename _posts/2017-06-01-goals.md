title: Bio and Goals
---

I have joined the Bloc program to become a full-stack developer. I have been interested in computers for almost my entire life, starting with Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and my first dell desktop at the age of 13. The joy of gaming has been with me ever since I can remember and along with that came my love for technology. As computers advanced, I loved findings new ways to use technology to make my life easier and more efficient. I then began building basic websites and forums for online gaming communities, and really started to understand the power of programming. Unfortunately this is where my programming ended as I went to college with the intent of being a lawyer. Once I realized the time and money it would take, I became a coach at a local private high school to rethink my path. It took me many years to come back to my true passion and finally made the leap to join Bloc and start my career in computer science.

Throughout life, my friends and I have come up with many ideas/apps to fill a need in our lives but no one was ever able to bring it to life. My goal in this program is to be able to take an idea from concept to market.  I wish to truly understand the front-end and back-end of everyday websites and apps, and learn to create my own. As technology grows and the internet of things becomes a reality, I want to know learn enough to be apart of it. I hope this program will jumpstart my career and help me learn the skills necessary to become a competent full-stack developer.
